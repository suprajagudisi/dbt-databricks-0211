🎯 **WHAT IS MICROBATCH?**
Microbatch is dbt's smartest incremental strategy. Instead of processing ALL
new data at once, it divides the work into time-based batches and processes 
them one at a time.

💡 **KEY BENEFITS:**

1. **Automatic Date Filtering**
   - You don't write WHERE event_date >= ... logic
   - dbt automatically filters each batch for you
   - Just set event_time='event_timestamp' and batch_size='day'

2. **Late Arrival Handling**
   - lookback=0: Process only new batches
   - lookback=2: Reprocess last 2 days + new data
   - Perfect for data that arrives late!

3. **Better Performance**
   - Smaller batches = faster queries
   - Failed batch? Only retry that batch, not everything
   - Easier to debug and monitor

4. **Simpler Code**
   - No manual is_incremental() logic needed
   - No complex date range calculations
   - dbt handles all the complexity

📅 **HOW IT WORKS:**

Initial run (--full-refresh):
  Step 1: dbt sees begin='2026-01-30'
  Step 2: Creates batches for 2026-01-30 and 2026-01-31
  Step 3: Processes each day's events separately
  Step 4: Table created with 20 events total (10 per batch)!

Future incremental runs:
  Step 1: dbt checks last batch processed
  Step 2: Identifies new batches to process
  Step 3: Creates batch for each new day
  Step 4: Processes only new day's events
  Step 5: Inserts new events!

With lookback=2:
  → Reprocesses last 2 batches + new batches
  → Catches any late-arriving corrections!

⚡ **VS OTHER STRATEGIES:**

APPEND:          ← Just dumps all new rows (no updates, no dedup)
MERGE:           ← Updates + inserts (SLOW on big tables)
DELETE+INSERT:   ← Manual partition logic (you write the dates)
INSERT_OVERWRITE:← Replaces partitions (need is_incremental check)
MICROBATCH:      ← 🏆 Automatic, smart, handles late data!

❄️ **SNOWFLAKE SPECIFICS:**
- Works with Snowflake's time travel and clustering
- Integrates with Snowflake tasks for automation
- Optimized for Snowflake's micro-partitions

WHERE 
    event_timestamp IS NOT NULL

-- ✨ dbt automatically adds its own WHERE clause here:
--    WHERE event_timestamp >= '2026-01-30 00:00:00'
--      AND event_timestamp < '2026-01-31 00:00:00'  (for batch 1)
--
--    WHERE event_timestamp >= '2026-01-31 00:00:00'
--      AND event_timestamp < '2026-02-01 00:00:00'  (for batch 2)
--
-- You don't write it - dbt does it for you based on:
--   • event_time='event_timestamp'
--   • batch_size='day'  
--   • Current batch being processed
